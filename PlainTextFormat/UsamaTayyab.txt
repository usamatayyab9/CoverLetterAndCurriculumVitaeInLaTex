| * AI Based Snake Game:                                                               |
|     An AI -based snake which uses three different algorithms for snake movement i.e. |
|     Breadth-first search (BFS), Depth-first search (DFS) and A* (heuristic based).   |
|     Random food for snake is generated every time. Game is over when the snake bites |
|     itself. This application is built using external C++ libraries SFML (Simple Fast |
|     Multimedia Library) for graphics. The type of algorithm is given at run time via |
|     a command line argument.                                                         |
|                                                                                      |
| * Minesweeper in C#:                                                                 |
|     A windows 7 like minesweeper game developed in C# using windows form platform as |
|     a part of course project.                                                        |
|                                                                                      |
| * Solved all problems of the book “The Modern C++ Challenge: Become an expert        |
| programmer by solving real-world problems”:                                          |
|     I solved all 100 problems in ”The Modern C++ Challenge” book, showcasing my      |
|     passion for problem-solving. I indulged into diverse topics such as primality    |
|     testing, Collatz conjecture, variadic template arguments, regex, working with    |
|     time zones in Qt, data structures, multithreading, design patterns, file         |
|     operations (XML, JSON, PDF), image manipulation, SQLite, cryptography and        |
|     networking.                                                                      |
|                                                                                      |
| * Solved 203 problems on LeetCode:                                                   |
|     As a hobby project I solved 203 problems on LeetCode. Which include 98 problems  |
|     on easy difficulty, 102 problems of medium difficulty and 3 problems of hard     |
|     difficulty. All the problems solved were related to data structures and          |
|     algorithms and were programmed in C++17.                                         |
|                                                                                      |
| * Search Engine of Wikipedia articles:                                               |
|     In this project all provided Wikipedia articles are first stored in memory then  |
|     queries are performed. Two different data structures are used to store data.     |
|     1. Hash map (unordered map) and tree structure (map) which are provided by C++11 |
|                                                                                      |
| * File Compression/Decompression-Huffman algorithm:                                  |
|     A set of programs are developed which compresses a text file given by the user   |
|     and then decompresses it. To achieve this Huffman algorithm was used. During     |
|     compression, the input file is read twice: First iteration file is traversed to  |
|     generate a Huffman tree and store it on disk. Second iteration is used to        |
|     compress a file. During decompression first the tree is loaded from the disk     |
|     then decompression is done.                                                      |
|                                                                                      |
| * Notepad and command prompt (Concept used “generic trees”):                         |
|     A Windows-like command prompt in which a user can create, edit, delete director- |
|     ies and files. For storing file and directory structure a custom made tree stru- |
|     cture was implemented. Along with a text editor in which a user can edit the     |
|     text of a file.                                                                  |
|                                                                                      |
| * Disk Sort/External Sort:                                                           |
|     In this project a program is developed which sorts an input file that can not be |
|     fit into RAM. Program reads the input file in chunks, sort each chunk and writes |
|     the sorted chunk in binary file. Then all binary files are merged to generate a  |
|     sorted output file.                                                              |
