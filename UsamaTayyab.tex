	\textbf{ACADEMIC/HOBBY PROJECTS}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{AI Based Snake Game:} An AI -based snake game using SFML which deploys three different algorithms for snake movement i.e. Breadth-first search (BFS), Depth-first search (DFS) and A* (heuristic based) to find the food. 
		
		\item \textbf{Completed "The Modern C++ Challenge" (100 Problems):} Solved all 100 problems in the book "The Modern C++ Challenge". These 100 problems comprised of topics such as primality testing, Collatz conjecture, variadic templates, regex, time zones, multithreading, design patterns, file operations (XML, JSON, PDF), image manipulation, SQLite, cryptography, and networking.
		
		\item \textbf{LeetCode Problem Solving (203 Problems):} Due to my passion for problem solving, I solved 217 problems on LeetCode. Solved 101 easy, 104 medium, and 12 hard problems focusing on data structures and algorithms in C++17.
		
		\item \textbf{Search Engine of Wikipedia articles:} Implemented a search engine of provided wikipedia articles using C++11 and STL containers (std::unordered\_map and std::map) for data indexing and retrieval. Afterwards a comparative analysis was performed to measure efficiency of hash-based and tree-based data structures.\\
		
		\item \textbf{File Compression/Decompression System:} Implemented Huffman algorithm for text file compression and decompression.
		
		\item \textbf{Disk Sort(External Sort):} Created program to sort files which are larger in size than RAM capacity using chunk-based sorting and k-way merge algorithm.
